                    Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have
                    revolutionized our ability to access location information.
                    In a nutshell, GNSS measures its distances from satellites
                    hovering over the earth in predefined orbits, through radio
                    signals, and estimates its position on Earth. However, these
                    systems have their own share of errors due to orbit errors,
                    satellite clock errors, receiver noise, ionospheric and
                    tropospheric delays, satellite geometry over the receiver,
                    multipath effects, etc., which cause dilution in precision
                    up to 10–11 meters. To overcome this accuracy limit, various
                    surveying techniques such as DGNSS, Static GPS/GNSS
                    surveying, RTK, SBAS, GBAS, and PPP are used by the
                    geospatial community. Each of these methods works on the
                    principle of taking GNSS measurements.

                In most GNSS applications where precise positioning is required,
                users pair their GNSS instruments with other GNSS instruments,
                simultaneously observing one or more known positions, termed as
                reference stations. With the help of these reference stations,
                estimated corrections to be applied over the point of interest
                or rover position are obtained through Static GNSS Survey or
                Real Time-Kinematic (RTK) Survey methods. To facilitate users by
                not requiring to set up their own reference station each time
                they wish to undertake GNSS measurement, and provide a
                country-wide consistent reference frame, Survey of India has
                established a network of Continuously Operating Reference
                Stations (CORS). These CORS stations are capable of providing
                Real-Time Positioning Service through RTK/NRTK with an accuracy
                of ±3 cm and also host an array of different positioning
                services targeted to cater to the requirements of the geospatial
                and scientific community.
              </p>
              <p>
                These networked CORS stations (or GNSS receivers) are permanent
                installations and continuously stream satellite observations to
                a central server. The entire setup of reference stations and the
                central server is known as the Continuous Operating Reference
                Station (CORS) Network. The central server runs specialized
                software that performs calculations to further refine the
                rover's position by sending Network Real-Time Kinematic (NRTK)
                corrections to the rover. The distance between a GNSS rover and
                the corresponding base station is no longer an issue. Users can
                subscribe to the CORS network on a monthly or yearly basis to
                receive NRTK corrections with their rover instead of having to
                set up their own base station. The CORS network is available 24
                hours per day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year, though it
                depends on the communication service provider and satellite
                availability.

                Data streaming of RTCM 2.4, RTCM 3.2 is supported in real-time,
                and users can also retrieve stored GNSS data from the central
                server via the internet for post-processing. Users can also
                submit static survey GNSS data for online processing.
